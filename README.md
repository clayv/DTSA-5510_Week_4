# BBC News Story Classification

This is the Week 3 project for DTSA-5510, Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning, and performs unsupervised learning algorithms to [BBC news stories](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/overview) from a machine learning competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
  
This project attempts to categorize or cluster BBC news stories based on the textual content of the story. After binning the stories, the bins are assigned the category names based on the highest predictive score and then these names are compared to the test data to determine the accuracy of the unsupervised learning method.
